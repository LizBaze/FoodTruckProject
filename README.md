# Food Truck Project

### Description
This program allows the user to input information for up to five food trucks including name, genre, and a rating.
Entering information for five trucks or entering 'Quit' when prompted to enter a truck name will then show a menu that gives the user choices of certain information they wish to display.

This was completed during week two of Skill Distillery's Full-Stack Java Development Bootcamp.

### Lessons Learned
- Incorporate README updates into dev process so I don't forget what lessons I've learned when writing it at the end of the project
- You can (dare I say, should) pass a Scanner object as an argument to a method
- The relationship between objects and classes can be complex, but it is clearly a very useful tool. I'm happy to be getting more comfortable with the concepts. 

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Git
